A web-based tool like Anki to learn the most common kanji (Chinese characters used in Japanese). This is to practice using FastAPI and to have a go at full-stack development.

Each day, the user must review (old and new cards) up to a certain limit. At each reivew, a card is sent forward in time depending on user feedback: 1 for poor to 4 for good recall.

I based the API off of the FastAPI tutorial from this website (https://dennisivy.com/fast-api-crud).
