# perapera
A web-based tool like Anki to learn the most common kanji (Chinese characters used in Japanese). This is to practice using FastAPI and to have a go at full-stack development.

Each day, the user must review (old and new cards) up to a certain limit. At each reivew, a card is sent forward in time depending on user feedback: 1 for poor to 4 for good recall.

I based the API off of the FastAPI tutorial from this website (https://dennisivy.com/fast-api-crud). Uses SQL Alchemy (SQLite).

<!-- 
- ReactJS used to create app `npx create-react-app perapera`
- Boostrap (CSS/Javascript framework/library)
- Start application from package.json with `npm start` from `frontend/perapera`
- Use Axios as API connection library to connect React application to FastAPI application `npm install axios`

App.js is the main file we work on

- Explain what FastAPI
- Explain what React is 
- Explain what Boostrap-React is
